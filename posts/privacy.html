Privacy Policy

The Effective Date of This Agreement is January 1, 2020

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") provides information on how wrkstrm Inc. ("wrkstrm" or "we") handles your privacy. It describes the information that we collect about you as a user of the app, wrkstrm, and our services, how we handle your personal information, how the information is used, and the choices that you have.

Please read this Policy carefully before you provide us with any personal information, install the Hacker News app, or use any wrkstrm services. For a Web version of this and other wrkstrm policies, please visit www.wrkstrm.me.

The Information That You Provide.

When using wrkstrm's websites, mobile applications (including but not limited to the wrkstrm application), products and services (collectively, the "Service," as further described in our Terms of Service), you do not need to create an account to use our Service, download applications, and/or receive support. 

The Information That We Collect and Use.

The Service and the wrkstrm application detect and use your location. If you use the Service, wrkstrm may receive and store information about your actual location (such as GPS and motion signals sent by your mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a Wi-Fi network). The information we receive and store may include your present location, as well as historical data about where you have been. We also may collect and store other usage information when you are using the Service.

Wrkstrm always remembers the places you visit or points you pass, by running in the background (or foreground), whenever your mobile device is ON, even if you switch to another application or navigate away to the mobile device's home screen or other screens or pages. It relies on GPS and Wi-Fi network location data to automatically determine the places you've visited or points passed, and for how long. Wrkstrm may be disabled by pressing the "Exit" or "Log-Off" button within the wrkstrm app.

We gather and use information about your activity to process and personalize the services we provide to you. When this data is stored on the device, it is encrypted. When it is transmitted to the wrkstrm servers, it is sent using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

Other Information We May Gather Through Tracking Technologies.

If you visit our websites, we may place a text file known as a "cookie" to your computer or other devices. A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path through our Web site and to determine whether you have visited us before. We use cookies to help us understand how visitors use our sites, and to help us to improve our sites and Service. You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by following the procedures specific to your Web browser. Although you may do so, you may find that your browser reacts strangely when visiting not only our websites, but other websites as well.

How We Use Your Personal Information

We take your privacy interests very seriously. We therefore do not share, rent or sell personally-identifiable information about you except as described in this Policy.

a. Our use of your information to improve your user experience.

Our goal is to provide you with the best possible user experience. To that end, we may use the information we collect for support, to develop new features, to provide you with statistics about you and/or your use of the Service, and to improve the overall quality of our service. In that instance, we may share your information with third parties who assist us with these tasks.

Also, if we provide you with technical support, we may retain your email address to facilitate contacting you in the future about technical matters.

Mobile and web analytics companies may access data (such as your IP address, device ID, or other data) to help us understand how our services are used. We believe our vendors take reasonable steps to safeguard the data they hold on our behalf, although data security cannot be guaranteed.

Our Use Of Non-Personal Information, And Other Circumstances Where Disclosure May Be Necessary.

a. Non-Personal Information. We reserve the right to use in any manner and also to disclose any non-personal information that we collect, including but not limited to cookie and traffic data (see "Other Information We May Gather Through Tracking Technologies"). We may use this information by itself, or aggregate it with information we have obtained from third parties.

b. Release Of Personal Information To Comply With Law And Where Otherwise Necessary. We may release personal information when we believe that doing so is appropriate to comply with the law (for example, to respond to a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply our policies; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our rights or property; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, our site, mobile apps, or services; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.

c. Third Parties Who Assist Us In Providing Your Service. We may use third party service providers to assist us with the administration of the Service or otherwise perform services on our behalf, including the presentation of maps and images. Such third parties may be supplied with or have access to your personal information solely to provide services to us or on our behalf.

d. Transfer Or Disclosure Of Information As A Company Asset. Information about our users, the Service, and the site is a business asset of wrkstrm. Consequently, information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition, reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of wrkstrm's assets, sale of the wrkstrm app or any individual component of the Service, creation of a separate business to provide the site, our services or fulfill products, or sale or pledge of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of wrkstrm.

Your consent will not be required for disclosure in the above cases (a) through (d).

e. Privacy Rights Of California Residents. Residents of the State of California have the right to request from certain businesses with whom the California resident has an established business relationship a list of all third parties to which the business, during the immediately preceding calendar year, has disclosed certain personally identifiable information for direct marketing purposes. We are only required to respond to a customer request once during any calendar year. To obtain this information, please send a request to [c](mailto:legal@alohar.com)monterroza@wrkstrm.me, with the subject heading "California Privacy Rights." In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that not all information sharing is covered by these California Privacy Rights Requirements, and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.

Links to Other Sites

wrkstrm's mobile applications and Web sites may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by wrkstrm. wkrstrm is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites, and encourages you to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Policy applies only to information collected by wrkstrm, its applications, Web sites and Service.

Information Sharing And Onward Transfer.

All data communication must be sent through your mobile carrier's network or Internet service provider (ISP) and your carrier or ISP may therefore have access to it. For information regarding your carrier's or ISP's treatment of your information, please consult your carrier's or ISP's privacy policies.

Certain of our products, mobile applications, and services allow you to interact and share your information with others. Please consider carefully before disclosing any personal information or data that might be accessible to others.

Removal Of Information Inadvertently Received From Children.

We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly remove the information.

Safe Harbor.

wrkstrm adheres to the U.S.-European Union Safe Harbor privacy principles. For more information about the Safe Harbor framework or our registration, see the United States Department of Commerce's web site. Further information about wrkstrm Mobile's products and services is available at www.wrkstrm.me.

Data Retention And Administrative Contact.

Our systems are designed to retain log, location, user, place and other data for two years after it is collected. This allows us to furnish you with the best possible user experience. We remove personally identifiable information (such as your email address) and other preferences associated with your wrkstrm account promptly after you formally request deletion of your account.
