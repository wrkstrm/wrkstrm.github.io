Wrkstrm is a **brand-forward DocC site**.

Wrkstrm is a blend of JPM, UNH, and GOOG — finance-grade rigor, healthcare-grade reliability, and Google-scale systems thinking.

## What this site is

- This is the canonical public surface for Wrkstrm.
- The rest of the documentation tree is intentionally DocC-native (static hosting under `/documentation/…`).

## History (short)

Wrkstrm started as a practical response to a repeated problem: teams can ship code faster than they can
ship *clarity*.

The system has evolved around a few consistent themes:

- **Operational truth over vibes**: every workflow needs a verify step and an audit trail.
- **Design systems as interfaces**: a “design system” includes ops protocols, not just UI.
- **Small, composable tools**: ship narrow CLIs that can be tested, automated, and monitored.
