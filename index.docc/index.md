Wrkstrm is an engineering ecosystem built around **documentation-first delivery**, **operational rigor**, and **small composable tools**.

It modernizes a decade of CLI practice into a unified system of **agentic assistants** and **type-safe software artifacts**—so teams can ship with clarity, auditability, and momentum.

## What we do

Wrkstrm helps engineering organizations:

- Turn documentation into operational interfaces (not just pages).
- Standardize workflows as explicit protocols.
- Build small tools that compose into systems.
- Keep delivery repeatable under production pressure.

## Mission

Make complex work repeatable: clear interfaces, explicit protocols, and systems that can be verified.

## How we’re different

### Documentation-first delivery

Documentation is treated as product surface area: it defines expectations, interfaces, and the “shape” of operations.

### Operational rigor

We prefer mechanisms that survive real-world constraints: incident pressure, rate limits, dependency drift, and human handoffs.

### Composability

We bias toward small tools with strong seams—so capabilities can be combined without turning into a monolith.

## Core capabilities

- **Agentic operations:** assistants with defined personas and mandates (orchestrator, documentation steward, incident responder).
- **Type-safe artifacts:** consistent identifiers/namespaces, manifests, and stable interfaces.
- **Protocol-driven execution:** workflows expressed as explicit steps and conventions.
- **Design system for docs:** predictable structure, navigation, and visual lanes for large doc sets.

## Trust by design

Wrkstrm is built to be understandable and auditable.

- Privacy, data handling, and permissions are documented.
- Terms and support expectations are explicit.
