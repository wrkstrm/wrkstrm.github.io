An architect's perspective on the generation and integration of SVGs within the build system.

## The Codex Philosophy: The SVG Is a Build Artifact

As an architect, I view SVGs as build artifacts. They should be generated from a single source of truth (e.g., Mermaid, PlantUML), and the generation process should be automated and reproducible. My focus is on the tooling and infrastructure required to generate, optimize, and integrate SVGs into our documentation and applications.
