# History

Wrkstrm is the product of a long-running obsession with making work *repeatable*.

It draws from three kinds of environments:

- **Finance-grade rigor** (the discipline you learn around risk, review, and operational controls —
  think JPMorgan Chase).
- **Healthcare-grade reliability** (the habit of designing for safety, durability, and clear
  handoffs — think UnitedHealth Group).
- **Internet-scale systems thinking** (the instinct to design for change and for long-lived
  platforms — think Google).

Over time, the emphasis shifted from “a set of personal CLI tools” into a coherent ecosystem:

- **Docs as an interface:** DocC is the primary surface.
- **Ops is part of the design system:** publishing protocols, monitoring, and audit trails are
  first-class.
- **Small tools, composed:** narrow CLIs you can automate, verify, and evolve.

This page is intentionally short for now; we’ll expand it with concrete milestones and links as we
promote more artifacts to public.
