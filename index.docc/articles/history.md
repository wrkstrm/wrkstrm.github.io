# History

Wrkstrm is the product of a long-running obsession with making work *repeatable*.

Over time, the emphasis shifted from “a set of personal CLI tools” into a coherent ecosystem:

- **Docs as an interface:** DocC is the primary surface.
- **Ops is part of the design system:** publish protocols, monitoring, and audit trails are first-class.
- **Small tools, composed:** narrow CLIs you can automate and verify.

This page is intentionally short for now; expand with concrete milestones and links as we promote more artifacts to public.
