Sketch-style SVGs communicate exploration, early-stage thinking, and softer constraints. Use them
when you want the reader to feel that a system is still being shaped, not finalized.

## When to use

- Early architecture explorations or concept drafts.
- Comparative studies where precision is less important than mood.
- Pages that should feel invitational rather than definitive.

## Core visual rules

- Favor hand-drawn strokes, low-contrast fills, and gentle jitter.
- Prefer layered washes over hard fills.
- Keep the motion subtle; use long durations and low-opacity animation.
