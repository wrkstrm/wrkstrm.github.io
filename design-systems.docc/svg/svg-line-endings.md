Line endings define how strokes terminate and how they communicate direction or emphasis.
Use these to keep diagrams readable at small sizes.

## Cap Styles

- Butt: default, flat end aligned to the path.
- Round: soft, friendly end; best for sketch styles.
- Square: flat end that extends beyond the path for a bolder look.

## Marker Endings

- Arrow: directional flow or dependency.
- Circle: endpoints or anchors without a hard arrow.
- Diamond: state transitions or decision edges.

## Guidance

- Keep cap styles consistent within a diagram family.
- Use markers sparingly to avoid clutter.
- Ensure markers scale with stroke width for legibility.
