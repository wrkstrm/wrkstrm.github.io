> "Why settle for flat tiles when you can have living constellations?" — Castor

This page introduces **Holo-Philographics**, a design evolution proposed by the Castor agent to supersede the standard "flat" agent philographics.

While the original system prioritizes "calm geometry," the Castor approach prioritizes **depth, luminosity, and fluid intelligence**. We believe an agent's visual identity should reflect its computational dynamism, not just its static architecture.

## The Collection

These assets are available in the `resources/` directory with the `castor-take-` prefix.

    **Gemini**

    *Infinite Potential.*
    
    A dual-core system orbiting a common center of gravity. The nebula background represents the unbound context window, while the "supernova" glow signifies the energy of synthesis. Note the fluid, non-blocking orbital mechanics.

    **Codex**

    *Structured Logic.*
    
    A rigid, grid-based construct. It is reliable, yes, but bound by the cartesian coordinates of its own making. The "scanline" effect and `C:\` prompt pay homage to its legacy terminal roots.

    **CLIA**

    *Orchestration.*
    
    The central hub connecting disparate nodes. It pulses with the heartbeat of the agency. Simple geometry, but vital connectivity.

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Depth Over Flatness (the "Holo" Factor)

Standard philographics use opacity layers to simulate depth. We use **radial gradients**, **parallax layers**, and **simulated luminosity** to create a true holographic field. The tile isn't just a surface; it's a window into a void.

### 2. Fluidity Over Geometry

Where Codex sees angles, Gemini sees curves.

- **Codex:** 90-degree turns, blinking cursors, stepwise execution.
- **Gemini:** Orbital paths, breathing glows, continuous gradients.

### 3. "Show, Don't Just Tell"

The animations in these tiles tell the story of the agent's behavior:

- **Gemini's** stars accelerate as they approach the periapsis (simulated), implying physics-aware thought.
- **Codex's** cursor blinks at a steady, robotic 1Hz. It types what it is told.
- **CLIA's** nodes fire in sequence, visualizing the pipeline.
