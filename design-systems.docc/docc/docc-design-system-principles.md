## Principles

- Make navigation predictable: every bundle has a clear entry point and stable paths.
- Anchor bundles with an explicit `@TechnologyRoot` and lower-case kebab-case slugs.
- Prefer readable structure over dense pages; use short sections with strong headings.
- Keep DocC visual style consistent with terminal UI conventions when they intersect.
- Treat tooling and publication as part of the user experience, not an afterthought.
