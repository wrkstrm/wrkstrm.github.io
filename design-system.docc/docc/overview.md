# Overview

Use the Overview page to orient readers quickly. This is the entry point for
humans and should answer three questions within the first paragraph:

- What is this package or bundle for?
- Who is it for?
- Where does it fit in the system?

Include

- Purpose and scope (one paragraph, plain language)
- Audience and context (who should read this)
- Non-goals or exclusions
- High-level capabilities and boundaries

Avoid long histories, deep architecture, or step-by-step instructions here.
