# Architecture

Use Architecture to show the component map and data flows. This is the most
visual page and should answer “how the system is shaped.”

Include

- Component diagram or list of modules
- Data flow or request lifecycle
- Boundaries and dependency directions
- Integration points with external systems

Prefer diagrams when possible; keep them simple and readable.
