# Getting Started

Use Getting Started to provide the smallest working path for a new user.
Prefer a short, success-oriented walkthrough that can be completed quickly.

Include

- Prerequisites (platform, tools, permissions)
- Minimal install/build/run steps
- A quick sanity check or expected output
- Where to go next for deeper topics

Keep steps short and reproducible; link to tutorials instead of duplicating
full walkthroughs.
