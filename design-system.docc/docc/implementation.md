# Implementation

Use Implementation to document the practical "how" once the design is set.
This page should help a new contributor make a safe change without
reading every file.

Include

- Key folders, entry points, and naming conventions
- Data or configuration formats that matter
- Extension points and safe areas to modify
- Testing or validation steps tied to this package

Avoid repeating design principles or long tutorials here.
