# Motivation

Use Motivation to capture why the work exists and what constraints shape it.
This keeps later design decisions grounded in reality.

Include

- The user or system pain being solved
- Constraints (policy, security, platform, time)
- Risks and trade-offs you cannot avoid
- Success criteria or measurable outcomes

Keep this focused on “why,” not the chosen implementation.
