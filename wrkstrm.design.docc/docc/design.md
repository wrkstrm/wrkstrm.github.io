# Design

Use Design to describe the guiding principles and trade-offs behind the
solution. This is where you explain why the approach was chosen.

Include

- Design principles (short bullets)
- Alternatives considered and why they were rejected
- Trade-offs you accepted
- Invariants and guarantees the design must uphold

Keep this page short and precise; the architecture page shows structure.
